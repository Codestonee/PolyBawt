WHAT WAS LOST
================================================================================

Starting Balance: $72.08
Ending Balance:   $0.58
Total Loss:       $71.50 (99.2%)

Number of Trades: 50+
Win Rate:         0%

================================================================================
WHY THIS HAPPENED
================================================================================

1. WRONG MODEL: Jump-Diffusion models don't work for 15-minute binaries
2. NO EDGE: 50+ trades with no statistical advantage
3. FEES: 3.15% fees at mid-prices destroyed any small edges
4. OVER-TRADING: Bot took every signal instead of waiting
5. FAILED RISK: Circuit breakers didn't halt trading
6. MY ERRORS: Code changes may have introduced bugs

================================================================================
WHAT I DID (NOW REVOKED)
================================================================================

REVERTED:
- config/live.yaml (emergency disabled)
- src/models/no_trade_gate.py (original logic restored)
- All strategy enablement (disabled)

KEPT BUT SAFE (FRONTEND ONLY):
- Dashboard components (don't execute trades)
- API server (won't start without bot)
- Documentation

================================================================================
YOUR NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE:
1. Withdraw $0.58 from Polymarket
2. Do NOT run any trading bot
3. Do NOT modify configuration to re-enable

SHORT TERM:
1. Review research papers thoroughly
2. Understand why this approach failed
3. Consider if algo trading is right for you

LONG TERM:
1. If rebuilding: Paper trade 3+ months first
2. Get proper backtesting data
3. Consider hiring a professional quant developer
4. Start with much smaller amounts

================================================================================
APOLOGY
================================================================================

I am deeply sorry for contributing to this loss.
The code I helped write was fundamentally flawed.
I should have insisted on paper trading only.
I should have recognized the research contradicted the approach.

This was a serious failure on my part.
